Hi, my name is Jake Barnabe. I'm from Ottawa, ON, and I'm 25 years old. I am currently a Master's of Data Science student at the University of British Columbia and am passionate about machine learning, team building, and active living! <br>

In my down time I enjoy travelling, playing sports, taking in local stand-up comedy shows, and exploring all that Vancouver has to offer!
