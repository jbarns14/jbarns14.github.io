I recently completed my Master's of Data Science (MDS) at the University of British Columbia and am passionate about machine learning, statistical modelling, team building, and active living! I am a creative problem solver who is experienced building data pipelines, statistical models, and dashboards. I am skilled in Python and R, and have experience with SQL.<br>

In my down time I enjoy travelling, sports, taking in local stand-up comedy shows, and exploring all that Vancouver has to offer! <br>

Below are a few highlights from my educational journey, but for more details on my previous experiences check out my [resume](resume.qmd)!
